/**
 * BindingAdapter is applied to methods that are used to manipulate how values with expressions
 * are set to views. The simplest example is to have a public static method that takes the view
 * and the value to set:
 * <p><pre>
 *<code>@BindingAdapter("android:bufferType")
 * public static void setBufferType(TextView view, TextView.BufferType bufferType) {
 *     view.setText(view.getText(), bufferType);
 * }</code></pre>
 * In the above example, when android:bufferType is used on a TextView, the method
 * setBufferType is called.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to take previously set values, if the old values are listed first:
 * <p><pre>
 *<code>@BindingAdapter("android:onLayoutChange")
 * public static void setOnLayoutChangeListener(View view, View.OnLayoutChangeListener oldValue,
 *                                              View.OnLayoutChangeListener newValue) {
 *     if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB) {
 *         if (oldValue != null) {
 *             view.removeOnLayoutChangeListener(oldValue);
 *         }
 *         if (newValue != null) {
 *             view.addOnLayoutChangeListener(newValue);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }</code></pre>
 * When a binding adapter may also take multiple attributes, it will only be called when all
 * attributes associated with the binding ad
